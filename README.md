# Yahscript      ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
A language for CMSI 488

Yahscript is a small language that will compile to javascript.

### Features

#### Comments
A single line comment is created with two foward slash characters. Multiline comments are started with two foward slashes followed by a backslash and ends with two back slashes followed by a single foward slash. 

```
//This is a single line comment

//\
This is a 
multiline comment

Still multiline

Multiline comment ends below. 
\\/

```

### Assignment
Unlike Javascript we do not use var to declare assignment. Yahscript also supports constants and, unlike javascript, you cannot edit the properties of an object constant.

```
//Example of declaring and assigning to four variables
x is 1
y is 2 - 1
z is 3 - 2
u is 4 - 3

//Example use of constants
4evah dog is 2

```

### Relational Operations

### Equivalency
Equivalency in Yahscript takes the form of eq(var1, var2). Paranthesis are not required.

```
print(eq 2,2 )
// yah would be the output
```
### Less than
Less than works a lot like Equivalency.
